Dialogue box closing the app:
The reason that your app was closing was that it was actually crashing.

```python
[MDRaisedButton
        (
            text="OK",
            on_release=self.dialog_dismiss, # This was the right command, but we needed to tweak it
        ),
    ],
```

With this syntax it works

```python
        buttons=[MDRaisedButton(text="OK", on_release=partial(self.dialog_dismiss, dialog))],
```

# Kivy MD Application Fixes

## Issue 1: Dialog Box Closing the Entire Application
To address the issue where pressing "OK" in the dialog box closes the entire application, ensure that the event handler for the "OK" button only contains a method to dismiss the dialog, like `dialog.dismiss()`, and does not include any command that might close the application.

## Issue 2: Adding a Scroll Functionality
To add scrolling functionality to your application:

1. Use a `ScrollView` widget. 
2. Ensure that the layout within the `ScrollView` has `size_hint_y` set to `None` and its height is set to accommodate all its children.
3. Adjust `size_hint_min` and `size_hint_max` properties of the children widgets.

### Example Code for ScrollView and Popup Dialog

```python
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout
from kivy.uix.scrollview import ScrollView
from kivy.uix.button import Button
from kivy.uix.popup import Popup
from kivy.uix.label import Label

class MyApp(App):
    def build(self):
        # Main layout
        layout = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical', spacing=10, size_hint_y=None)
        layout.bind(minimum_height=layout.setter('height'))

        # Add widgets to the layout
        for i in range(50):  # Just an example to create a long list
            btn = Button(text=f'Button {i}', size_hint_y=None, height=40)
            layout.add_widget(btn)

        # Create a ScrollView
        scroll_view = ScrollView(size_hint=(1, None), size=(Window.width, Window.height))
        scroll_view.add_widget(layout)

        # Create a popup dialog
        popup_content = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical')
        popup_content.add_widget(Label(text='Your message here'))
        close_button = Button(text='Close', size_hint_y=None, height=40)
        popup_content.add_widget(close_button)

        self.popup = Popup(title='Dialog Title', content=popup_content, size_hint=(None, None), size=(400, 400))
        close_button.bind(on_press=self.dismiss_popup)

        return scroll_view

    def dismiss_popup(self, instance):
        self.popup.dismiss()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyApp().run()
```

## Implementing Dialog Dismissal in Kivy MD

### Using a lambda function:

```python
def show_summary_popup(self, name, mood_ratings, average_rating, additional_info):
    # Setup summary text and dialog...
    dialog = MDDialog(
        # Setup dialog...
        buttons=[MDRaisedButton(text="OK", on_release=lambda *args: self.dialog_dismiss(dialog))],
    )
    dialog.open()

def dialog_dismiss(self, dialog):
    dialog.dismiss()
```

### Using functools.partial:

```python
from functools import partial

def show_summary_popup(self, name, mood_ratings, average_rating, additional_info):
    # Setup summary text and dialog...
    dialog = MDDialog(
        # Setup dialog...
        buttons=[MDRaisedButton(text="OK", on_release=partial(self.dialog_dismiss, dialog))],
    )
    dialog.open()

def dialog_dismiss(self, dialog, *args):
    dialog.dismiss()
```

# Implementing ScrollView in KivyMD

To ensure that the content in a KivyMD application displays correctly within a `ScrollView`, we need to make certain adjustments to the layout and the `ScrollView` itself. Below are the detailed steps taken to implement a `ScrollView` in the provided code:

## Adjusting the Root Layout

The root layout, which contains all the UI elements, needs to be adjusted to work with `ScrollView`. Here's what was done:

1. **Set `size_hint_y` to `None`**:
   - The `size_hint_y` property of the root layout (a `BoxLayout` in this case) is set to `None`. This is crucial because `ScrollView` requires an explicit height of its child widget to function correctly.
   
2. **Bind `minimum_height` to `height`**:
   - The root layout's `minimum_height` is bound to its `height` property. This ensures that the layout can expand to accommodate all its children, and `ScrollView` will be able to calculate the necessary scrolling area.

## Configuring the ScrollView

After adjusting the root layout, the `ScrollView` itself is configured:

1. **Initialize ScrollView with Size Hints**:
   - A `ScrollView` is created with `size_hint` set to `(1, None)`. This allows the `ScrollView` to expand horizontally to fill its parent but not vertically.
   
2. **Set ScrollView's Size**:
   - The size of the `ScrollView` is explicitly set to the size of the window (`Window.width`, `Window.height`). This ensures that the `ScrollView` occupies the full screen.

3. **Add Root Layout to ScrollView**:
   - Finally, the root layout is added to the `ScrollView`. This makes all the content within the root layout scrollable if it exceeds the visible area of the `ScrollView`.

By following these steps, the application's UI can be made scrollable, accommodating more content than what fits on the screen at once.

## Additional Import

- It's important to import `Window` from `kivy.core.window` to use the window size for setting the `ScrollView`'s size.

## Example Code

Here's the modified `build` function with the above changes:

```python
from kivy.core.window import Window

def build(self):
    root_layout = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical', spacing=10, padding=20, size_hint_y=None)
    root_layout.bind(minimum_height=root_layout.setter('height'))

    # [Rest of the UI layout code]

    scroll_view = ScrollView(size_hint=(1, None), size=(Window.width, Window.height))
    scroll_view.add_widget(root_layout)

    return scroll_view
